# Assignment 4 - 3DGS

This repository is JunyiWang's implementation of Assignment_04 of DIP. 

### Step 1 Use the MVS to generate the 3D point cloud
## Results
We use the image from the oringinal images:

The result of mvs is as follows:

### Step 2 Use the 3DGS to conduct reconstruction
## Results
The 3DGS of python version we use:

<img src="result/3dgs_p.png" alt="alt text" width="600">

The 3DGS of oringinal version:

<img src="result/3dgs.png" alt="alt text" width="600">

## From the results, we can see that the 3dgs can generate the 3d model from the 2d images, and the performance of 3DGS is very good
